<h1>For You, Ayesha 💖</h1>

<p>
As this year begins, I want you to know something simple:
your presence in my life makes everything lighter.
</p>

<p>
May this year bring you calm on difficult days,
laughter that doesn’t fade,
and moments that make you proud of how far you’ve come.
</p>

<p>
No matter where life takes us,
I hope you carry a quiet certainty
that someone out here is rooting for you.
